Several packages support making beautiful tables with R, such as

* [xtable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/)
* [stargazer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/)
* [pander](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/)
* [tables](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tables/)
* [ascii](http://eusebe.github.io/ascii/)
* [Create Awesome HTML Table with knitr::kable and kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html#table_styles)
* etc.

It is also very easy to make tables with knitr's `kable` function:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5, ], caption = "A knitr kable.")

###Add some kable
library(kableExtra)
head(mtcars)%>%kable()%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"), font_size = 11, full_width = F, position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, color = "white", background = "blue", font_size = 12)


```
